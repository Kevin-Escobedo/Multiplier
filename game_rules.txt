Explanation of Game:
1. Each player is given 2 cards.
2. Ace = 1 point, Jack = 11 point, Queen = 12 point, King = 13 point, 2-10 = 2-10
3. Black cards (clubs and spades) are considered positive, red cards (diamonds and hearts) are negative
4. For each card, the player rolls a die; the result is the "mulitiplier".
5. For each card, a coin is flipped. If the result is heads, the mulitiplier is the die roll. If tails, there is no mulitiplier.
